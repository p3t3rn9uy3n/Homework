# Homework
In this homework assignment, I have adjusted the html semantic tags to be able to clearing identify the content in the index.html file. Alt tags have been added to the images to for if the image cannot be displayed it can show a text title. I have cleaned up the CSS and have combined some targets together by using container class to those sub classes. Assignment has been pushed to github along with commit messages to every change made.
